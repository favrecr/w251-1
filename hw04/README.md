2. ConvnetJS MNIST Demo

In this lab, we will look at the processing of the MNIST data set using ConvnetJS. This demo uses this page: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/mnist.html The MNIST data set consists of 28x28 black and white images of hand written digits and the goal is to correctly classify them. Once you load the page, the network starts running and you can see the loss and predictions change in real time. Try the following:

- Name all the layers in the network, make sure you understand what they do.

**Layer 1:** Input Layer -  
**Layer 2:** Convolutional Layer -  
**Layer 3:** Pooling Layer -  
**Layer 4:** Convolutional Layer -  
**Layer 5:** Pooling Layer -  
**Layer 6:** Loss Layer - In softmax, the outputs are probabilities that sum to 1. 

- Experiment with the number and size of filters in each layer. Does it improve the accuracy?



- Remove the pooling layers. Does it impact the accuracy?



- Add one more conv layer. Does it help with accuracy?



- Increase the batch size. What impact does it have?



- What is the best accuracy you can achieve? Are you over 99%? 99.5%
